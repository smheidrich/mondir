## Similar projects

- [dirtempl](https://pypi.org/project/dirtempl/): Same idea as this one, but
  doesn't support Jinja2 template syntax.
- [dirtemplate](https://pypi.org/project/dirtemplate/): Also the same idea
  *and* also uses Jinja2. But I only found out about it after I wrote mine and
  now the sunk cost fallacy compels me to stick with it no matter what.

## Name explanation

Given that the obvious names from the "Similar projects" section were taken and
my working title (*fisyte*, for **fi**le**sy**stem **te**mplates) sounded dumb,
I stole
[how Jinja got its name](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/faq/#why-is-it-called-jinja),
i.e. by using a word that means *temple* (because that sounds a bit like
*template*) in another language.
The first translation of *temple*
[on Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/temple#Translations) that also
contains the fragment *dir* (for *directory*) is the Bengali word *mondir*.
So that's it.
