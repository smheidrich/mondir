Mondir
======

Mondir is a Python library that allows you to template out whole directory
trees using Jinja2 templates with a few syntax extensions.

Despite Mondir being implemented "on top" of it, most of Jinja's own API is
left accessible, so you can e.g. use additional extensions, custom loaders,
custom configuration, and so on with it.
