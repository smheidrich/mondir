Installation
============

Via pip
-------

To install from PyPI:

.. code:: bash

  pip3 install mondir

Source code
-----------

The source repository can be found at
`on GitLab <https://gitlab.com/smheidrich/mondir/>`_.
There is also a
`GitHub mirror <https://github.com/smheidrich/mondir>`_,
but I much prefer GitLab so all development happens there.
